# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from **The Odin Project** (TOP) Foundations course. It is a simple recipe website built to practice the fundamentals of HTML and Git.

## Lessons Learned
In this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
* **HTML Structure**: Using headings, paragraphs, and lists.
* **Navigation**: Linking between multiple HTML files and managing directory structures.
* **Assets**: Implementing images with proper attributes.
* **Git/GitHub**: Working with the command line to clone, add, commit, and push changes via SSH.
